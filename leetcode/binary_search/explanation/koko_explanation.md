# Why Return `l`?

You're searching for the **smallest value of `k`** such that Koko finishes within `h` hours.

## Binary Search Logic

- **If** `total_hours > h`:  
    This `mid` is too slow  
    â†’ Need to try higher speeds  
    â†’ `l = mid + 1`

- **If** `total_hours <= h`:  
    This `mid` works  
    â†’ Try to find a smaller one  
    â†’ `r = mid - 1`

You are shrinking the search range such that:

- All `k < l` are **invalid**
- All `k >= l` **could be valid**

When the loop ends (`l > r`), `l` is pointing at the **first valid speed** â€” the answer âœ…

## Example Walkthrough

Let's walk through this with:

```python
piles = [3, 6, 7, 11]
h = 8
# Initial range: l = 1, r = 11
```

| l | r  | mid | total_hours      | Action   |
|---|----|-----|------------------|----------|
| 1 | 11 | 6   | 1+1+2+2 = 6 â‰¤ 8  | r = 5    |
| 1 | 5  | 3   | 1+2+3+4 = 10 > 8 | l = 4    |
| 4 | 5  | 4   | 1+2+2+3 = 8 â‰¤ 8  | r = 3    |

ðŸ”š **Exit:** `l = 4`, `r = 3` â†’ loop ends.

âœ… **Return** `l = 4` â€” the minimum valid speed.

## ðŸ§© Key Insight

You **never store a separate answer variable**.

Instead, you're using the fact that `l` will land on the **smallest `k`** such that `total_hours(k) <= h`.
